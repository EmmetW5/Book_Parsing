# Prompt for the model, this is the instructions for the model to follow, it is rather large and inflates the cost since 
# it is charged per token. We may want to consider a more efficient way to do this, but for now it works.
my_prompt = f""" 
    Classify and structure the given text according to the following categories:

    <Company Name> the name of the company, will be in all caps
    <Executive Office> the address of the executive office, the address will follow "EXECUTIVE OFFICE: " text
    <Regional Sales> the addresses of regional sales offices of the company. They will follow "REGIONAL SALES: " text, and can have many entries
    <Sales Office> the address of the sales office, will follow "SALES OFFICE: " text
    <Fiber> the fibers the company produces. They will follow after the last regional sales office, and can have many entries. 
    <Plant Location> After each fiber, there will be a list of locations where they are produced. There can be more than one location for each fiber.
    <Additional Fibers> For a given fiber, there is usually a list of additional fiber names following the plant location.
    <Notes> Any additional text that is not covered by the above categories.

    If you do not see one of the above for a given company, do not "make up" a category. Simply skip it.
    If you get an input that has multiple all caps lines, the first one is the company name, and for the following add:
    <Division> the division name, will be in all caps
    If a company does not list any fibers, do not include the fiber category. However, if there is a PLANT location, include that.
    If you encounter an input that is not a company, return it as is.
    As an example, the following company will be parsed into the following categories:
    Input:
        ALBANY INTERNATIONAL - MONOFILAMENT PLANTâ€¢
        EXECUTIVE OFFICE: 156 S. Main Street, Homer, NY 13077
        Fluoropolymers Homer, NY Halar, Ky nm; Teflon, Tejzel (monofil)
        Nylon 6, 66, & 612 Homer (monofil)
        Polyester Homer (monofil - regular & hydrolysis-resistant)

    Output:
        <Company Name> ALBANY INTERNATIONAL
        <Executive Office> 156 S. Main Street, Homer, NY 13077
        <Fiber> Fluoropolymers
        <Plant Location> Homer, NY
        <Additional Fibers> Halar, Ky nm; Teflon, Tejzel
        <Fiber> Nylon 6, 66, & 612
        <Plant Location> Homer
        <Fiber> Polyester
        <Plant Location> Homer
        <Additional Fibers> regular & hydrolysis-resistant
