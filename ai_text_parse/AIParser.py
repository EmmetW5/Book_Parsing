# my_prompt = f""" 
#     Classify and structure the given text according to the following categories:

#     <Company Name> the name of the company, will be in all caps
#     <Executive Office> the address of the executive office, the address will follow "EXECUTIVE OFFICE: " text
#     <Regional Sales> the addresses of regional sales offices of the company. They will follow "REGIONAL SALES: " text, and can have many entries
#     <Sales Office> the address of the sales office, will follow "SALES OFFICE: " text
#     <Fiber> the fibers the company produces. They will follow after the last regional sales office, and can have many entries. 
#     <Plant Location> After each fiber, there will be a list of locations where they are produced. There can be more than one location for each fiber.
#     <Additional Fibers> For a given fiber, there is usually a list of additional fiber names following the plant location.
#     <Notes> Any additional text that is not covered by the above categories.

#     If you do not see one of the above for a given company, do not "make up" a category. Simply skip it.
#     If you get an input that has multiple all caps lines, the first one is the company name, and for the following add:
#     <Division> the division name, will be in all caps
#     If a company does not list any fibers, do not include the fiber category. However, if there is a PLANT location, include that.
#     If you encounter an input that is not a company, return it as is.
#     As an example, the following company will be parsed into the following categories:
#     Input:
#         ALBANY INTERNATIONAL - MONOFILAMENT PLANTâ€¢
